⚠️ **Important:**  
You must **unzip the OpenGL folder** and keep it in the **same directory** as all the `.py` files.  
Otherwise, the game will not run.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Python
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Check version:
```bash
python --version
```
2. Install Required Libraries

If OpenGL is not installed, run:
```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
```
3. OpenGL Folder Setup (IMPORTANT)

Download the provided OpenGL zip file

Unzip the OpenGL folder

Place the OpenGL folder inside the project directory

Keep all .py files and the OpenGL folder in the same folder

4. How to Run the Game

Open terminal in the project folder

Run the following command:  python 2Dgame.py

🎮 Game Controls

1. Left Arrow (←) → Move catcher left

2. Right Arrow (→) → Move catcher right

3. ESC → Exit the game

🔄 Game Process / Working Logic

The OpenGL window is initialized

1. A diamond falls from the top at a random position

2. The player moves the catcher using arrow keys

3. If the catcher catches the diamond: Score increases, Diamond resets to the top

4. If the diamond reaches the bottom: Game Over
